                    Ptolemaic military operations were a dominant factor in the spread of Egyptian cults across the early Hellenistic Aegean

                <div class="value">Early in the Ptolemaic era, Egyptian cults, particularly those of Isis and Sarapis, spread
                    successfully to ports across the ancient Aegean Sea. Leading researchers in the field claim that the
                    spread of these cults was influenced by multiple factors, ones that were mainly economic or political
                    in character. However, the question of which factors had more weight or impact than others in the process
                    of the early spread of Egyptian cults has not yet been answered in academic discussion. This could be
                    related to the fact that the issue of the spread of religious innovations in the ancient Mediterranean
                    has been addressed mainly by established historiographical methods such as the collection and critical
                    analysis of archaeological and literary sources. Hypotheses and conclusions derived from these methods
                    are, however, often unable to reflect the complexity of historical processes. A possible solution can
                    be found in supplementing this established methodological apparatus by formalized methods, e.g. the coding
                    of relevant datasets, statistics, geospatial modeling, and network analysis. To be able to compare the
                    possible impacts of different factors on the spread of Egyptian cults in the Aegean Sea region, we 1)
                    constructed a model of the ancient maritime transportation network as a platform for quantitative analysis,
                    2) transformed selected factors of possible influence into georeferenced parameters of the network, and
                    3) defined a mathematical model that allowed us to determine which parameters of the network explain
                    the spatial dissemination of archaeological evidence connected to Egyptian cults. The results suggest
                    that the most significant correlation is between the placement of Ptolemaic garrisons and the distribution
                    of Egyptian temples and artefacts in the early Hellenistic Aegean Sea region. The interpretation would
                    be that Egyptian military forces potentially played a significant role in the spread of Egyptian cults.</div>

                <div class="value">This paper presented a new method for identifying promising areas for archaeological research.
                    The method is based on graph analysis that iteratively compares and manipulates Hamming distances between
                    graphs of input geographical parameters and graphs of human activity data in various historical periods.
                    The weights learned from the comparison was used to build a prediction model to estimate the potential
                    presence of an archaeological site of a certain time period in a given cadaster. This was applied in
                    the Bohemian Moravian Highlands region based on the most complete archaeological dataset of the area.
                    Resulting maps were analyzed from the archaeological and historical point of view to test against the
                    existing knowledge of prehistoric population movement in the region. Overall, the method proved to overcome
                    problems such as fragmentary inputs and is a good candidate for application in smaller and geographically
                    diverse research areas. The aim of this work was to contribute to the methodology of the prediction of
                    historical human activity, to facilitate greater comprehension of past local settlement dynamics, and
                    to possibly ease the protection of cultural heritage.</div>

                    for investigation, crime prediction, and planning of police forces. The public availability of crime
                    data is one of the often discussed issues for the police, general public and academia. The efforts to
                    open police data are rooted in the philosophy of the so-called ‘community policing’. In this article,
                    we demonstrate the possibilities of spatial analysis and cartographic visualization of open crime data.
                    We provide two use cases based on the data gathered by the municipal police in Pardubice, Czech Republic.
                    We investigate the impact of gambling sites on crime offence intensity and found that gambling sites
                    considerably influence their surroundings within 100 m. The other use case is focused on traffic offences
                    caused by cyclists. We extracted hot spots of these offences and tried to identify their causation, since
                    the police should not only carry out repressive measures, but also strive to eliminate the causes (e.g.
                    add cycle lanes, bike paths, underpasses or overpasses). Different types of cartographic visualization
                    have been designed and discussed for both use cases. The advantages, limitations and future development
                    of the described concepts are commented on in the conclusion.</div>

                    approaches and theories for processing and evaluating various data. Also therefore GIS technologies are
                    currently penetrating various fields of science. This contribution is focused on specific issues connected
                    with application in studies of historical religions within GEHIR project (A Generative Historiography
                    of the Ancient Mediterranean), which is focused mainly on the ancient Mediterranean. Selected issues
                    as nature and properties of historical spatial data, environmental modelling in religious studies etc.,
                    will be demonstrated on example of case study dealing with the cult of Isis. Results show potential of
                    GIS for purposes of research studies in the field of the Religious studies.</div>
